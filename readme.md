System Design

🚀Vendor Management: A system for managing vendors, including registration, approval, and deactivation.

🚀Product Management: A system for managing products, including adding, editing, and deleting products.

🚀Order Management: A system for managing orders, including processing and shipping orders.

🚀Payment Gateway Integration: Integration with a payment gateway to facilitate transactions between vendors and customers.

🚀Inventory Management: A system for managing inventory, including tracking stock levels and generating reports.

🚀Customer Management: A system for managing customers, including registration, login, and account management.

🚀Shipping Management: A system for managing shipping, including generating shipping labels and tracking shipments.

🚀Reporting: A system for generating reports, including sales reports, inventory reports, and customer reports.

🚀Rating and review system: A system for customers to rate and review products, vendors and their services, which can help to improve the overall customer experience.

🚀Marketing and promotion tools: A system for vendors to create and manage promotions, discounts, and other marketing campaigns to increase sales.

🚀Customer service: A system for vendors to handle customer inquiries and complaints, as well as a system for customers to track their orders and returns.

<!-- For Delivery Person -->

🚀Order tracking: The shop manager can track all the orders placed by customers, including the delivery status, in real-time. This allows them to manage and optimize the delivery process.

🚀Sales reports: The shop manager can generate sales reports that show the total revenue generated by the shop, the number of orders placed, and the most popular products. This allows them to analyze their sales data and identify trends.

🚀Inventory management: The shop manager can track the inventory levels of their products and set reorder points to ensure they always have enough stock. This allows them to manage their inventory effectively and optimize their profit.

🚀Cost management: The shop manager can track the costs of their products, including the cost of goods sold, and compare it to the revenue generated. This allows them to calculate their profit margin and identify opportunities to reduce costs.

🚀Commission tracking: if the shop manager is using a multivendor platform like Amazon or Etsy, they can track their commission for each sale and calculate their profit after deducting the commission.

🚀Delivery tracking: The shop manager can track the delivery person and see the delivery status, delivery location, and delivery cost, which helps them to optimize their delivery cost and improve their profit.

<!-- Our Main Planning to Built With Django and NextJs -->

🔥Start by setting up the Django backend. This includes creating a database schema, defining models, and building an API that will be consumed by the Next.js frontend.

✔️Next, set up the basic structure of the Next.js frontend, including the layout, navigation, and routing.

✔️Integrate the Next.js frontend with the Django backend by building a custom wrapper around the Django REST Framework to handle authentication and authorization.

✔️Build the vendor management system by creating views and templates for vendors to register, login, and manage their products. Use Django's built-in user authentication system for vendor management.

✔️Build the product management system by creating views and templates for customers to browse and purchase products. Use Next.js's dynamic routing to handle product details pages.

✔️Implement the order management system by creating views and templates for customers to place orders, view order history, and track the status of their orders. Use Django's built-in database models to manage orders.

✔️Integrate a payment gateway, such as Stripe, to handle transactions between vendors and customers.

✔️Build an inventory management system by creating views and templates for vendors to manage their inventory, track stock levels, and generate reports.

✔️Build a customer management system by creating views and templates for customers to register, login, and manage their account. Use Django's built-in user authentication system for customer management.

✔️Build a shipping management system by creating views and templates for vendors to manage their shipping, generate shipping labels, and track shipments.

✔️Develop the reporting system by creating views and templates for vendors to generate sales reports, inventory reports, and customer reports.

✔️Make sure to add security features like SSL encryption, Firewall and access control to protect the system from unauthorized access and data breaches.

✔️Test the system thoroughly and make necessary adjustments before deploying it to a production environment.

"""It's a good idea to have a clear understanding of the requirements and the overall architecture before starting the development process."""

<!-- FrontEnd Idea -->

In a multi-vendor e-commerce website, a customer would typically have access to pages such as:

📕Homepage: showcasing featured products, promotions, and categories
📕Product list page: where customers can browse and search for products
📕Product detail page: where customers can view details and reviews of a specific product
📕Shopping cart page: where customers can review and edit the items they have added to their cart
📕Checkout page: where customers can enter their shipping and billing information and complete their purchase
📕Order history page: where customers can view their past orders and track the status of current orders

Vendors, on the other hand, would typically have access to pages such as:

📕Dashboard: where vendors can see an overview of their sales and performance statistics
📕Product list page: where vendors can view and manage the products they have listed for sale
📕Order management page: where vendors can view and update the status of orders for their products
📕Inventory management page: where vendors can view and update their product inventory levels

Delivery persons would typically have access to pages such as:

📕Dashboard: where delivery persons can see a list of the deliveries they are assigned to for the day
📕Delivery detail page: where delivery persons can view details about a specific delivery, such as the recipient's address and contact information
📕Delivery history page: where delivery persons can view past deliveries and update the status of current deliveries.

It should be noted that these are just examples and the specific pages and functionality will depend on the requirements of the website.
